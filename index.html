The Oscars, everybody was expecting a night a wonderful night of wonderful Actors receiving there awards 
but nobody was expecting the evening to have a "real" moment. Which is exactly what we got when the amazing Actor Will Smith, Slapped the mess out the amazing comedian Chris Rock. 
I guess somebody still hates chris. When the comedian said a "out of pocket" joke of the actor wife, Will Smith walked up on stage and violated Chris Rocks cheek. 
I know his face must have been sizziling more than a fajita skillet. But the Mr. Rock kept it civil and the night continued.
As for Mr. Smith he won Best Male Actor and received a standing ovation. Although the night seemed well, it looks like recuppersions are coming now for the Fresh Prince. 
I guess time will tell what happens.
